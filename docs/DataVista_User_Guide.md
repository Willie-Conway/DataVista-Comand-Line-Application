## Installation

To use "DataVista," you need Python 3.x installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the application:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Willie-Conway/DataVista.git
   cd DataVista


## Installation

To use "DataVista," you need Python 3.x installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the application:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Willie-Conway/DataVista.git
   cd DataVista

   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   ```
3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

## Getting Started

Run the application using the following command:

```
python src/data_vista.py --data path/to/your/data.csv

```

Replace `path/to/your/data.csv` with the path to your dataset.

## Loading Data

1. The app will prompt you to enter the path to your CSV file.
2. If the file is successfully loaded, you will see a confirmation message. If there’s an error, appropriate error messages will guide you.

## Preprocessing Data

Once the data is loaded, you can preprocess it:

1. The app automatically handles missing values and converts date columns to datetime format.
2. You will receive a notification upon completion of the preprocessing step.

## Splitting Data

You will be prompted to enter the target column name for splitting the data:

1. Enter the name of the target variable (e.g., `Weekly_Sales`).
2. The app will split the data into training and testing sets, and you will receive a confirmation message.

## Data Visualization

After splitting the data, you can choose from several visualization options:

1. **Distribution Plot**
2. **Bar Chart**
3. **Box Plot**
4. **Scatter Plot**
5. **Scatter Plot with Linear Regression**
6. **Histogram**
7. **Pie Chart**

Enter the corresponding number for your choice, and the app will generate the selected visualization.

## Error Handling

The app is designed to provide user-friendly error messages. If you encounter issues such as missing files or invalid column names, follow the guidance in the error messages to resolve them.

## Data Flow Overview

1. **Loading Data**:
   - User provides a CSV file path.
   - `load_data()` reads the file and populates `self.data`.

2. **Cleaning Data**:
   - `clean_data()` processes `self.data` to remove duplicates and handle missing values.

3. **Preprocessing Data**:
   - `preprocess_data()` formats the data for analysis (e.g., date conversion).

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - User selects a column for analysis.
   - `statistical_analysis()` computes and logs various statistics.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - User selects a hypothesis test type (e.g., T-Test, Chi-Squared).
   - `perform_hypothesis_testing()` conducts the test and logs the results.

6. **Machine Learning**:
   - User specifies a target column.
   - `machine_learning()` trains a model and logs the performance.

7. **Clustering**:
   - User selects clustering parameters.
   - `perform_clustering()` identifies natural groupings in the data and logs results.

8. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - User selects a time series column and forecasting method.
   - `perform_time_series_forecasting()` generates forecasts and logs findings.

9. **Data Visualization**:
   - User selects a visualization type and column.
   - `visualize_data()` generates and displays the chart.
